Hello everybody, today we are going to be talking about USB and JavaScript. But before we start, let me introduce myself. My name is Gergana, but I usually go by Gery, because that's a bit easier to pronounce. I work for a company called BBD, we are a software consulting firm, but I work in the research and development team. A lot of people ask me what my team does, and the plain, boring answer is that we do some specialised consulting, training of the BBD developers and of course research. However, that's not all we do, we also have quite a bit of fun, doing things like building meme generators, using fruit for keyboards to play games and hacking astromech droids.

This last one is how I started out, and it is the thing that motivates me to never just settle for an app that a robot may come with, and to always keep looking for new and more innovative ways of hacking things, usually using JavaScript.

But as I mentioned earlier, today we are talking about USB. What are some things that come to mind when I say USB? Keyboard? Mouse? Printer? Flash Drive? USB has kind of become the de-facto standard for wired peripherals. USB devices are everywhere, and used for so many "things".

Most modern USB devices are plug and play, and usually they are quite easy to use. But every now and then you plug something into your computer and the dark side of the force says this... (device installing image) and the worst part is that more than half the time you were only ever going to use that thing that you plugged in that one time, never again. But now those drivers will be on your computer forever more.

Has anyone here ever tried to integrate one of their solutions with a USB device? Sometimes, depending on the device it is pretty simple, there is a common API you can connect to and use, or someone has already integrated with it before. The problems come when that API becomes outdated, and relies on Windows XP with Internet Explorer 8 and a whole bunch of VB6 code that some person wrote before you were even born, but it works so you are not allowed to touch it. 

This leads to problems, XP is an old operating system, IE 8 has security issues, the people who understand the code that was written 30 years ago are already retired. And all of us developers are like magpies, we are attracted to new and shiny technologies, we really don't want to be maintaining code that is older than we are.

Before I tell you the solution, let me give you another example.
