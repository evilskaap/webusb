# Help me WebUSB, you're my only hope

If I told you this talk is about USB, you would probably think of something mundane like a mouse, keyboard or printer. But these are not the droids we are looking for. What if I told you it is about USB on the web?

For me, USB devices running on the web include adventures with ActiveX, Internet Explorer 8 and Windows XP. USB devices whose drivers only run under very specific and relatively old conditions, but are still a requirement. We have one of three options: We settle for what we have been presented with, we splash out and replace all of the devices, or we find a new, more creative, cross-platform solution.

JavaScript: A new hope! In this talk I would like to tell you about the WebUSB API, what it is, how it works, and what it means for web developers. Using some devices I have had to deal with, I will show you how to connect to them directly from the browser. The WebUSB API gives us hope for the future of integrating hardware and the web.
